# Flow Builder Application

A visual workflow automation tool similar to Zapier Workflows, allowing users to create, configure, and manage automated workflows through a drag-and-drop interface.

## Overview

The Flow Builder application enables users to create automated workflows by connecting different nodes (triggers, actions, conditions) in a visual drag-and-drop interface. Users can configure each node, establish connections between them, and save/load their workflows.

## Key Features

1. **Visual Flow Builder Canvas**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for adding and arranging nodes
   - Visual connections between nodes
   - Zoom and pan functionality for navigating complex workflows
   - Undo/redo functionality

2. **Node Configuration**
   - Node type selection from a sidebar/palette
   - Properties panel for configuring node parameters
   - Reusable component templates

3. **Real-Time Preview and Validation**
   - Live flow preview as nodes are added or modified
   - Visual cues for configuration issues
   - Basic validation for flow integrity

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Interactive tutorials and tooltips
   - Responsive design for various devices

5. **Backend API**
   - REST endpoints for saving, loading, and managing flows
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Persistent storage of flow configurations

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js for UI components
- React Flow for the drag-and-drop canvas
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express for the REST API
- MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage
- JWT for authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start the development servers
