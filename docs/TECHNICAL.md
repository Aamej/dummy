# Flow Builder - Technical Documentation

This document provides detailed technical information about the Flow Builder application, including architecture, data models, and implementation details.

## Architecture Overview

The Flow Builder application follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: A React single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface for building and managing workflows.
2. **Backend**: A Node.js/Express REST API that handles data persistence, authentication, and business logic.
3. **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, workflow configurations, and application state.

## Frontend Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Flow Builder Canvas
The canvas is the central component where users build their workflows. It's implemented using React Flow, a library for building node-based editors and diagrams.

Key features:
- Drag-and-drop functionality for adding and positioning nodes
- Connection lines between nodes to establish workflow relationships
- Zoom and pan controls for navigating complex workflows
- Selection and multi-selection of nodes
- Undo/redo functionality

#### 2. Node Palette
A sidebar component that displays available node types that users can drag onto the canvas.

Node categories:
- Triggers (starting points for workflows)
- Actions (operations performed in the workflow)
- Conditions (decision points in the workflow)
- Transformers (data manipulation nodes)

#### 3. Properties Panel
A dynamic panel that displays configuration options for the currently selected node.

Features:
- Form inputs for configuring node parameters
- Validation of input values
- Dynamic rendering based on node type
- Save/cancel controls for configuration changes

#### 4. Toolbar
A component providing global actions for the flow builder.

Actions:
- Save workflow
- Load workflow
- Create new workflow
- Undo/redo actions
- Zoom controls
- Run/test workflow

### State Management

The frontend uses React's Context API and hooks for state management:

1. **FlowContext**: Manages the state of the flow canvas, including nodes, connections, and selection state.
2. **AuthContext**: Handles user authentication state.
3. **UIContext**: Controls UI state like sidebar visibility, active panels, etc.

### Data Flow

1. User interactions with the canvas trigger state updates in the FlowContext.
2. Changes to the flow are validated in real-time.
3. When a flow is saved, the state is serialized and sent to the backend API.
4. When loading a flow, data is fetched from the API and deserialized into the FlowContext.

## Backend Architecture

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT
- `GET /api/auth/me`: Get current user information

#### Flows
- `GET /api/flows`: List all flows for the authenticated user
- `GET /api/flows/:id`: Get a specific flow by ID
- `POST /api/flows`: Create a new flow
- `PUT /api/flows/:id`: Update an existing flow
- `DELETE /api/flows/:id`: Delete a flow

### Data Models

#### User Model
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  name: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Flow Model
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  userId: ObjectId (reference to User),
  nodes: [
    {
      id: String,
      type: String,
      position: { x: Number, y: Number },
      data: Object (node-specific configuration)
    }
  ],
  edges: [
    {
      id: String,
      source: String (node id),
      target: String (node id),
      sourceHandle: String,
      targetHandle: String
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization

The backend uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:

1. When a user logs in, the server validates credentials and issues a JWT.
2. The client includes this JWT in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
3. Protected routes verify the JWT before processing requests.
4. Flows are associated with a user ID to ensure users can only access their own flows.

## Implementation Details

### Node Types and Configuration

Each node type has a specific schema defining its configuration options:

#### Trigger Node Example
```javascript
{
  type: 'trigger',
  subtype: 'webhook', // or 'schedule', 'event', etc.
  configuration: {
    // Webhook-specific configuration
    endpoint: String,
    method: String,
    headers: Object
    // or Schedule-specific configuration
    schedule: String, // cron expression
    timezone: String
  }
}
```

#### Action Node Example
```javascript
{
  type: 'action',
  subtype: 'http', // or 'email', 'database', etc.
  configuration: {
    // HTTP-specific configuration
    url: String,
    method: String,
    headers: Object,
    body: Object
    // or Email-specific configuration
    to: String,
    subject: String,
    body: String
  }
}
```

### Flow Validation

Flows are validated at multiple levels:

1. **Frontend Validation**:
   - Ensures all required node configurations are complete
   - Validates that connections make sense (e.g., no circular references)
   - Checks that the flow has at least one trigger and one action

2. **Backend Validation**:
   - Performs deeper validation of node configurations
   - Ensures the flow structure is valid
   - Validates user permissions

### Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Form validation errors with user-friendly messages
   - API error handling with appropriate UI feedback
   - Connection and network error detection

2. **Backend**:
   - Structured error responses with HTTP status codes
   - Validation errors with specific field information
   - Authentication and authorization errors
   - Database error handling

## Performance Considerations

1. **Canvas Rendering**:
   - Virtualization for large workflows to maintain performance
   - Throttling of real-time updates during drag operations
   - Optimized rendering of connection lines

2. **API Optimization**:
   - Pagination for listing flows
   - Partial updates to minimize data transfer
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

3. **Database**:
   - Indexing on frequently queried fields
   - Efficient query patterns to minimize database load
   - Consideration of document size limitations for large workflows

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - JWT with appropriate expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - HTTPS for all API communications

2. **Authorization**:
   - Resource-based access control for flows
   - Validation of user ownership for all flow operations

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
   - Secure handling of sensitive configuration data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Sharing flows between users
   - Collaborative editing of flows
   - Version history and rollback

2. **Advanced Flow Features**:
   - Nested workflows
   - Conditional branching with complex logic
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

3. **Integration Ecosystem**:
   - Pre-built integrations with popular services
   - Custom integration development framework
   - Marketplace for sharing integrations
